In the quest to improve blood donor management, we decided to come up with a dashboard that makes the process of identifying eligible donors easier. Languages Python HTML/CSS Bootstrap Framework Django It can work with any client-side framework and can deliver content in almost any format (HTML, JSON, XML, etc) Django provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords, donor information is really sensitive and needs to be secure from unauthorized users. Requirements Heroku Heroku is a platform as a service (Paas) that enables developers to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Heroku offers a free plan to experiment and find out what works best for you. Heroku supports the Python programming language. PostgreSQL database Postgres is a free and open-source database management system that is extensible and SQL compliant Postgresql source code is freely available under an open-source license Postgres has a filter clause that can be used to aggregate data based on certain criteria. DATABASE Name- redswift db USER-Redswift PASSWORD-Imanage User-oito Password-sharon Api Documentation API documentation explains how developers can integrate other products with your product using an API (application programming interface). Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio offers a 30-day free trial. Twilio APIs are available online in their documentation. User Experience Design documentation User experience design begins at the requirements stage and proceeds through all the stages of development, including the testing and post-release stages. The process of UX design includes research, prototyping, usability testing, and the actual designing part, during which lots of documentation and deliverables are produced. The UX documentation can be divided into stages. The research stage includes: User personas User scenario Scenario map User story map UX style guide This will help the users understand the project better from conception to development and why the product is actually useful. Source code document A source code document is a technical section that explains how the code works. While it\u2019s not necessary, the aspects that have the greatest potential to confuse should be covered. The main users of the source code documents are software engineers. Source code documents may include but are not limited to the following details: HTML generation framework and other frameworks applied Type of data binding Design pattern with examples (e.g. model-view-controller) Security measures Other patterns and principles Try to keep the document simple by making short sections for each element and supporting them with brief descriptions. This will help other engineers who might want to interact with the code of the product or in the future when we need to add any improvements to the code. Process documentation Process documentation, on the other hand, is a document that shows an internal team what they need to know to properly execute a task. It covers information that helps create consistency and accountability within your organization, including: Plans, schedules, and notes that establish standards and patterns for different processes Reports and metrics that track project, staff, and resource performance Internal wiki Product documentation Product documentation encompasses in-depth guides, training manuals, and information that show users how a product should work or how to use a product. When most people say \u201ctechnical documentation,\u201d they are talking about product documentation. Product documents typically cover instructions and tutorials to help end-users accomplish a task. They include guides, illustrations, and reference sheets that cover: Information on the requirements or system specifications users need to run the product efficiently Installation and usage instructions Frequently asked questions (FAQs) or knowledge base For product documentation, it\u2019s recommended to leverage technical writing software and software documentation tools to create easy-to-use and help documentation.","title":"End of year documentation"},{"location":"#end-of-year-documentation","text":"","title":"End of year documentation"},{"location":"#project-layout","text":"","title":"Project layout"},{"location":"#red_swift","text":"","title":"Red_Swift"},{"location":"#summary-of-the-research","text":"Primary and secondary research was conducted on 3 blood donor organizations in Kenya to find out how they manage their donors\u2019 information.
