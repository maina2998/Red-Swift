## Summary of the research
Primary and secondary research was conducted on 3 blood donor organizations in Kenya to find out how they manage their donors’ information. In the quest to improve blood donor management, we decided to come up with a dashboard that makes the process of identifying eligible donors easier.

## Languages
Python
HTML/CSS
Bootstrap

## Framework
Django
It can work with any client-side framework and can deliver content in almost any format (HTML, JSON, XML, etc)
Django provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords, donor information is really sensitive and needs to be secure from unauthorized users.

## Requirements
Heroku 
Heroku is a platform as a service (Paas) that enables developers to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
Heroku offers a free plan to experiment and find out what works best for you.
Heroku supports the Python programming language.

## PostgreSQL database
Postgres is a free and open-source database management system that is extensible and SQL compliant
Postgresql source code is freely available under an open-source license
Postgres has a filter clause that can be used to aggregate data based on certain criteria.

## Api Documentation
API documentation explains how developers can integrate other products with your product using an API (application programming interface).
Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.
Twilio offers a 30-day free trial.
Twilio APIs are available online in their documentation.

## User Experience Design documentation
User experience design begins at the requirements stage and proceeds through all the stages of development, including the testing and post-release stages. The process of UX design includes research, prototyping, usability testing, and the actual designing part, during which lots of documentation and deliverables are produced.
The UX documentation can be divided into stages. The research stage includes:
User personas
User scenario
Scenario map
User story map
UX style guide
This will help the users understand the project better from conception to development and why the product is actually useful.

## Source code document
A source code document is a technical section that explains how the code works. While it’s not necessary, the aspects that have the greatest potential to confuse should be covered. The main users of the source code documents are software engineers.
Source code documents may include but are not limited to the following details:
HTML generation framework and other frameworks applied

## Type of data binding
Design pattern with examples (e.g. model-view-controller)
Security measures
Other patterns and principles
Try to keep the document simple by making short sections for each element and supporting them with brief descriptions.
This will help other engineers who might want to interact with the code of the product or in the future when we need to add any improvements to the code.


## Process documentation
Process documentation, on the other hand, is a document that shows an internal team what they need to know to properly execute a task. It covers information that helps create consistency and accountability within your organization, including:

Plans, schedules, and notes that establish standards and patterns for different processes
Reports and metrics that track project, staff, and resource performance
Internal wiki


## Product documentation
Product documentation encompasses in-depth guides, training manuals, and information that show users how a product should work or how to use a product.

When most people say “technical documentation,” they are talking about product documentation. Product documents typically cover instructions and tutorials to help end-users accomplish a task. They include guides, illustrations, and reference sheets that cover:

Information on the requirements or system specifications users need to run the product efficiently
Installation and usage instructions
Frequently asked questions (FAQs) or knowledge base
For product documentation, it’s recommended to leverage technical writing software and software documentation tools to create easy-to-use and help documentation.
